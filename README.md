## Chat UI

Implement a chat UI for mobile devices similar to e.g. [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) or [Facebook messenger](https://www.messenger.com/).
Mock the server calls, i.e. implement only the frontend(with tests).

You should implement the following views and navigation between them:
- Chat list: 
  - list chats in which you are participant (there can be multiple participants in a chat)
  - clicking an item in the chat list will take you to that chat's details view
- Chat details view: 
  - list all messages in the chat. Messages may contain text, emoticons & images.
  - functionality to send a new chat message
  
Technology constraints & considerations:
- Use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) or [React native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
- You may use additional libraries, but if you do explain why you did
- Include instructions how to run the app & tests. Include enough mock data for us to test your UI.
- If using React, you might want to have look at the available boilerplate projects to get started, e.g. https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate
